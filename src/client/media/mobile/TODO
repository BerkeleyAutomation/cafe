introduce jquery enavbar
2 clicks, slider raters and register

--------------
use fluiddivs in rate page
social media buttons

google font
login page
clean up register page, length width height
score
links
sliders taking up full page

sliders whole length
question when rating
prevent horizontal scrolling
score -> blue bar
bottom bar?
score text animation
d3 spread out blooms
fonts
percentage layout of page
score server hole
we don’t want to host jquery locally for speed, security updates
color scheme, layout


There is a lot of vertical space free, put a compelling image or screen shot on the landing page. Possible ideas, blooms, stats, etc. D3 has some interesting visualizations maybe find one that might be cool to do with our data.
2.  Make sure the question text is the “short form” one of the JSON fields, this is just because if we want to ask a multi-part question we may not want to put the entire question there.
3. Back -> Done
After the ratings make the button become done
4. Instructions don’t change, do some sort of transition to give the use meaningful instructions. Move the box down, round corners, and float.
5. Sliders don’t reset after back
6. After 2 full ratings, pull up statements page.
7. After statements, pull up registration
8. Login page is bad. We should make it take the whole screen.
9. Score is completely missing
10. Better sizing for fonts, use more of the screen.
