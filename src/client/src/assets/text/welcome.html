The Garden is a new online research tool developed by Hybrid Wisdom Labs and Silverman Research to help communities suggest ideas and develop understanding about a particular issue – in this case, Social Media in organisations. The Garden will allow you to:

	<b>-</b> See where you stand in relation to other participants on fundamental social media issues
	<b>-</b> Evaluate and respond to the responses proposed by other participants.
	<b>-</b> Crowd source the best ideas about how to improve the adoption of social media in organisations

It works like this:
<b>1)</b> You start by expressing your opinion on five broad statements about Social Media – this will determine the position of your bloom in the Garden. 

<b>2)</b> You then write a short response to a discussion question, in this case: “What do you think are the main barriers for organisations in embracing social media practices and what ideas do you have for overcoming them?

<b>3)</b> Through The Garden’s visualization, you can then see where you stand in relation to other participants.

<b>4)</b> You can then read, rate and respond to the responses of other participants – and see which themes are resonating with the community.

<b>5)</b> This is not like a survey – you should return to see how your bloom progressing, as well as evaluating more responses as new ones emerge.
