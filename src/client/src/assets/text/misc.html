<img src="http://hybridwisdom.com/media/img/jon.png" alt=""/>The world of work is changing rapidly.  In my view, the new opportunities provided to organisations by new, social technologies to bring their people together, to help them connect then build and maintain relationships, and to share information and build upon each other's ideas are some of the most profound shifts that are taking place.  Organisations can gain some significant direct benefits from this enhanced collaboration, but they can also benefit indirectly from increased employee engagement too.  This is because people generally find connecting, working and learning with each other to be a highly compelling and stimulating experience.

This is why I'm such an advocate for Michael Silverman's approach in <font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://strategic-hcm.blogspot.com/2011/03/symposium-events-employee-engagement.html" target="_blank">employee engagement</a></font> and other research.  Research should provide employees with an engaging experience!  By providing people with a compelling visual representation of the questions being asked, and other people's answers, together with an opportunity to comment and build on these in a social way, Silverman Research and Hybrid Wisdom have translated what is usually an organisational chore into a much more interesting and productive activity.

In looking at broader opportunities for using this technology, Michael Silverman has rightly identified organisational use of social media as a fitting topic for research.  Although quite a bit of research already exists on this topic, things are changing quickly, and more importantly, research has never been completed in a social way.  I therefore expect this research study to produce many new insights about the use of social media at work.

As the research unfolds, I will be reporting on the<font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://strategic-hcm.blogspot.com/search/label/SMGarden" target="_blank">emerging conclusions on my blog.</a></font>
