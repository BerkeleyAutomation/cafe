<font size="20"><b>The Collective Discovery Engine</b></font>

The Collective Discovery Engine is an interactive visual and social environment designed to allow participants to interact and evaluate ideas around topics of interest. Each instance has a central discussion topic, eg. “How can Social Media enhance primary and secondary learning?”. The system collects ideas around this topic of interest as well as quantitative data about the participants in the system. 

The "map" of blooms represents the diversity of participants. The location of each person's bloom on the map is based on how he or she answered the baseline questions.  The size of each bloom is based on its reputation. Participants that are similar to you create blooms close to yours, and blooms that are far apart correspond to people who had very different responses.  

Participants can read and evaluate other's suggestions. These evaluations are incorporated into a scoring model that considers the similarity between participants' profile responses when analyzing ratings. If a suggestion receives a good rating from a participant who has similar responses, it accounts for less. Conversely, if a suggestion receives a good rating from a participant that has very different responses, it accounts for more.
