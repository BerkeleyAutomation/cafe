<b><font color="#646462" size="22">1. Why do I have to rate the five statements?</font></b>
This is a way to get a baseline understanding of your opinions about social media issues. Your ratings are used to position you in the space so that you are near participants with similar opinions.

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">2. How do I know where I am in the Garden?</font></b>
You are the blue bloom.

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">3. What does my position in the space mean?</font></b>
The position of your bloom is determined by the data entered by you and the other participants on the five initial statements: it is computed using statistical dimensionality reduction techniques. The Garden is designed to move beyond the usual left-right linear spectrum to display a diversity of opinions. Try moving your sliders to see how changes in your opinion will affect the position on your bloom in the Garden. (Please note that your initial ratings of the five statements are fixed and cannot be changed).

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">4. How do I interpret the garden? Do blooms near me correspond to participants with similar opinions?</font></b>
Rather than orientation of the axes, The Garden's "map" should be interpreted by the distance relationships between blooms. If two people have similar opinions their blooms will be close by, but the converse is not necessarily true.  What you are looking at is s projection of 5 dimensions on a 2 dimensional plane.  

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">5. Why are some blooms larger than others?</font></b>
State-of-the-art reputation algorithms automatically bubble up the most insightful responses. The size of a bloom is a reflection of how other participants have rated the insightfulness of that response. 

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">6. What does the colour of a bloom mean?</font></b>
The colour of a bloom is dictated by how much other participants agree with that participant's response. More people agree with purple/red blooms compared to yellow/orange blooms.

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">7. How do I rate other peoples’ responses?</font></b>
You should rate other participants' responses by clicking on their bloom and using the sliders in the bottom right, underneath their response. You should rate each response in terms of how much you agree with it and how insightful you think it is.  You will see a "+1" when you rate each response. The number of blooms you have explored is displayed in the top right corner. You can also click "Leave a Comment" to respond to a particular bloom. All suggestions received by each bloom can be seen by clicking "View Comments".

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">8. How many responses should I rate or respond to?</font></b>
As many as possible in the time you have. You should return to the Garden frequently before it closes on 29 February 2012.

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">9. How many times can I visit the space?</font></b>
You can visit the space as many times as you like.

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">10. How do I know which responses I have rated?</font></b>
When you have rated a bloom it disappears. Click on "Rated Responses" on the top right to see the blooms you’ve rated.

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">11. Why does my bloom move some days even though I haven't changed my opinions?</font></b>
We run Principal Component Analysis regularly to re-compute the best possible mapping into two dimensions, and this often gives new meaning to the axes of the space. While your bloom remains at the same five-dimensional location, as defined by your responses to the five initial propositions, its projection onto two dimensions will change periodically.

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">12. Are all of the blooms in the space shown at once? What if it gets too cluttered?</font></b>
Showing you all participants’ blooms at once would be information overload – exactly what the Garden is designed to overcome. We show you a stratified selection of 20 blooms at a time that you can rate and respond to. The remaining blooms can be seen as grey dots in the background. We use algorithms to select which 20 responses to show you based on how many times various blooms have been rated, recency of the bloom and diversity of underlying opinion. In this way all blooms have an equal chance to be heard and developed.  You can click on "More Responses" to see 20 more blooms. In this way, because it doesn’t use linear lists of responses, the Garden can facilitate dialogue with unlimited participants.

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">13. What if I have rated all 20 responses?</font></b>
Click on “More Responses” to show a new batch of responses for you to rate.

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">14. What if someone makes an inappropriate response?</font></b>
Inappropriate responses can be reported by clicking the “Flag” button

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">15. What statistics can I see?</font></b>
If you click the “Stats” button you can see a selection of scores about your response:
	-Response Score: This reflects how agreeable and insightful other participants think your response is. The score also incorporates a measure of confidence and takes into account the spatial distance between the rater’s and author’s blooms (we especially want to identify consensus responses – ie responses that people resonate with no matter how their underlying opinions differ to that of the author)
	-Response Rated By: This is the number of participants who have rated your response
	-Collaborator Score: This reflects the number of other participants’ responses you have commented on. 

Once more that 5 people have rated your response, you can see a further breakdown of how your bloom is being rated in the charts that will appear.

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">16. How do I know if someone has rated me or left a suggestion for my response?</font></b>
Notifications are displayed in brackets on the “Notifications” button, click the button for more detail. 

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">17. Why do you want my email?</font></b>
We will send you a weekly update email during the completion period to notify you of how your bloom is progressing in the Garden. We promise not to give your email to anyone else and we will not pester you with emails! See our privacy policy for more details.

<b><font color="#646462" size="22">18. How will the results be reported?</font></b>
Following a thorough statistical and textual analysis the results and recommendations will be shared with all participants.
