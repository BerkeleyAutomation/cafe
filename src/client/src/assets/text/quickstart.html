First enter your opinion on the five initial statements by setting sliders to indicate your degree of agreement with the statements. 

<b><font color="#FFFFFF" size="22">Next, type your response to the current Discussion Question</font></b>
The location of your point, highlighted in blue, will be based on the opinions you entered.  The arrangement of points is based entirely on the data collected by the system. The arrangement is statistically optimized to convey the underlying distribution of opinions. 

<b><font color="#FFFFFF" size="22">Try clicking on your point</font></b>
You'll see your username and your responses. If you adjust your sliders, your point will immediately change its position in Opinion Space. Click on other points to read what others wrote in response to the current discussion question. The size of the points is based on an overall quality of the response that takes into account the ratings of others and their relative distances in the space.
