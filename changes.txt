1. Changed the number of grades to A, B, C, D, and F in crc-transparent-slider.js (Currently
trying to map letters to the faces to minimize coding changes while changing the displayed
images. )

2. Changed the widths of .crc-div-wrapper and .slider in crc-transparent-slider.css to make 
all of the buttons fit one line. Will this cause problems on different sized screens?

	.crc-div-wrapper{
	max-width: 500px !important; /*Changed to make from 320 px this wider*/
	}

3. Commented out the code in crc-transparent-slider.js and doneRating function in rate.js
that changes the background image when you place your mouse over things. We will come
 back to this if necessary.

Things that I would like:
1. Class "dialog dialog-style" in mobile.html is the median page. We would need to modify
that page to add the different images.
